üöÄ **HackerRank Solutions**

Welcome to my personal collection of HackerRank C++ practice solutions.  
This repository is designed to sharpen core C++ skills, improve algorithmic thinking, and reinforce clean code practices.

üìö **Contents**

Each folder or file in this repo corresponds to a specific HackerRank challenge.

Organized by difficulty:
- üü¢ Easy
- üü° Medium
- üî¥ Hard

```
üìÅ {Difficulty}/
    üìÅ {Category}/
        üìÅ {Problem}/
            üìÅ {c++ version}/
                üìù Problem.md
                üìù Solution.cpp
                üìÅ build/
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Each problem `build/` folder is **!GENERATED!** when Solution.cpp is being compiled.

**üõ†Ô∏è Compiler & IDE**

- OS: **Windows**  
- Compiler: **MSVC (cl.exe)**  
- IDE: **VS Code**  
- Build configs: defined in `launch.json` and `tasks.json`  

**‚ñ∂Ô∏è Build & Run**

From a problem folder, build using the provided tasks (VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+B`).  
Executables are generated inside the problem‚Äôs `build/` directory.
